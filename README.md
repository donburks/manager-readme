## What is this?

This document is intended to be a primer for working with me in the context of my being a manager in your organization and you being someone who reports to me. It can be informative for those that I report to, allowing them insight into how I intend to do my job. All statements contained herein are mine, the opinions are mine, the bad jokes are also, unfortunately, mine.

## Background

Okay, so who is this guy? That's the first question anyone at `${COMPANY}` would likely ask about me, if they didn't know me. Who do I think I am that I can just sit in this seat and claim that I am the right person to do what I do?

Well, I'm Don. Hi!

I have over twenty years as an IT professional, having worked every job from junior programmer to ad trafficker to DevOps to Production Manager to CTO. In my IT career I have also spent significant time learning about payment processing, serving of digital ads, call centres, and computational thinking. Professionally, I have programmed in Perl, PHP, Ruby, and JavaScript. I have worked for companies such as Microsoft(MSN), Best Buy Geek Squad at the corporate level, MetroLyrics.com, Lighthouse Labs, and Amazon. I have also been founder or employee #1 at a dozen startups in my career.

I am a published author, with two books (one that is fantasy fiction and one technical tome about software project planning) so far. I am an accomplished musician, with a BA in Music Performance from Columbus State University. I currently play with several semi-professional organizations in the Lower Mainland, including being Principal Horn and Assistant Conductor with the Vancouver Pops Orchestra.

I like to juggle, I'm opinionated, I adore bad puns and quick wit, and I am fairly comfortable talking about anything except fish and flowers. I'm also very comfortable speaking in public, as I have spoken at conferences all over the world, and performed with orchestras in three countries. I love public speaking, performing, and teaching, and will do it whenever I can.

Whatever mistakes I may have made at earlier points in my career, I want you to know that I regret them, and thanks to great colleagues who have patiently given me feedback and the opportunity to correct myself and improve as a person, I do not expect to ever make those mistakes again. Let me be transparent and upfront that personal growth is worth more to me than comfort. 

## Hopes & Dreams

I want to own a 1969 Camaro RS one day. Or a brand-new BMW M5. 

I want to play on stage at Carnegie Hall and in the pit orchestra for either a Broadway or West End show. 

I want to publish many more books, both fiction and non-fiction. 

I want to jump out of a perfectly-working airplane, with a perfectly-working parachute on my back. The last part is **very** important to this process. 

I want to do a driving tour of Tuscany.

## Approach

One of the aspects to my style as a professional is that I like to use aphorisms to communicate values and standards. You can expect to hear these repeated in your interactions with me, as they are some of the fundamental principles I hold behind how we approach the job of delivering digital solutions to paying customers. Here is a selection of my more common aphorisms:

> "Courage is deciding there is something more important than being scared."

This one is so important to me I have it tattooed on my arm. A lot of what prevents us from taking risks, innovating, and doing what we know is the **Right Thing To Doâ„¢** is fear. If we can focus on a value, an outcome, or a person as being the beneficiary of our work, then we have found a reason to succeed. I believe in finding reasons that we will succeed, not reasons we will fail.

> "Good enough isn't good enough, if it can be better."

Too many times have I seen the FISI (F<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">&lt;censored&gt;</span> It, Ship It) mentality end up having detrimental effects on the company in terms of revenue, market share, or brand image. Deadlines are critical, however the goal is for the company to deliver its _best_ work by that deadline. I believe in constantly challenging the status quo and asking ourselves if we have the time, will, skill, and drive to improve what we deliver.

> "Working code is worth more than pretty code."

This seems like it contradicts the previous point, but I contend that it doesn't. I'm coming into a new situation where there is a lot of code that exists and has shipped, and has generated revenue. It's not my intention to come in and devalue all the work that `${COMPANY}` has done. It worked. It shipped. Beautiful, refactored, linted code that follows every possible optimization recommendation...and doesn't work? That doesn't help us. If it's beautiful but doesn't solve the problem, then it is a new problem we also have to solve and doubles our workload.

> "We didn't hire you to code."

I have always believed that there is no company out there in the universe that hires developers to write code. No HR manager, anywhere, is looking for people to write code. That isn't the job you're hired to do. Unequivocally, **developers are hired to build and support products**. That means you have to keep the product in mind at all times. Is this creating the right experience for the user? Is this fulfilling the promise that the product makes? Is this a feature or behaviour that you would be willing to put your face on a billboard and claim as your work?

> "The five most dangerous words in product development are 'Wouldn't it be cool if...'."

The answer is always 'yes'. With infinite resources, infinite time, unlimited staffing, we can build every beautiful idea we have. However, just because an idea would be cool doesn't mean that it's the right solution for our users, doesn't mean it aligns with `${COMPANY}`'s mission, and doesn't mean that it is the right way for us to allocate resources at this time. We always have to balance the urge to innovate with the urge to build something for the sake of building it. I will always encourage acting on the former urge, and will always listen to the latter urge, though likely won't take any action on it. 

## Expectations

In this section, I want to outline some of the expectations for each other that we are likely to share at `${COMPANY}`. I believe in understanding the difference between _accountability_ and _responsibility_ for the success of any initiative. If an initiative fails, it is always easy to blame the people who were responsible for implementing it. However, I will usually look to the people accountable for its success as where I would do the most work to improve and repair processes. Those that are responsible for implementation bear the burden of the strategy which was laid out for them. 

My role in `${COMPANY}` is focused around accountability. As such, here are the expectations we can have for each other, split into buckets that identify the source of the expectation.

### Yours

You can expect me to be an advocate for your success. This means that my job is to give you an environment within which you can be successful. This is, of course, within reason. We likely would all be more successful if we had reclining massage chairs, bottomless coolers full of energy drinks, beer, and good whiskey, and someone to bring us regular infusions of bacon and cheese. However, that isn't in anyone's budget. What is possible, however, is that I am going to keep the following things as priorities that you can count on, in order to give you the best chance for delivering an amazing product:

* **Availability** - I will endeavour to keep all avenues of communication open, including my literal or proverbial office door. You can send me a message any time you want. I will do my best to respond promptly. That message can be e-mail, online messaging, SMS, phone, carrier pigeon, or smoke signals. I have no problems giving you my phone number. Your message might occur on a holiday or a weekend, and that's okay. It might be some other form or time that is convenient for you, and I will work with you to develop a communications strategy that gives us both what we need. Additionally, my calendar is the definitive arbiter of whether I am available. If you need time with me and my calendar doesn't allow it, let me know. I will find or make the time. (_Disclaimer_: If I have headphones on, please send me a message before approaching me directly.)

    My order of urgency with respect to medium of communication:
    
    f2f > Phone Call > SMS > Slack > E-mail > Paper

* **Quality of Work** - I'm always going to be delivering the best quality work that I can. That means everything from how I show up in meetings to my written correspondence, even down to code reviews. 
* **Transparency** - I will tell you everything I can about anything you need to do your job as effectively as possible. `${COMPANY}` may ask me not to share some things with you from time to time, and I will take that into account. **I will not lie to you.** And if the circumstance ever happens where I tell you something and it later is proven false or inaccurate, then it is not because I chose to deceive you. It's because things that were beyond my control changed, and I will own the result of that. 
* **Respect** - I will always treat you respectfully, as an adult and a professional. Whether that is to your face, or behind closed doors, it will not change my intent or my values. This includes how I interact with you directly, and how I refer to you with others.

If I ever fail to live up to your expectations, I encourage and invite you to _let me know_ so that I can resolve the issue, correct my behaviour, and develop strategies to hold up my end of the bargain moving forward. I am only human.

### Mine

* **Availability** - If you are supposed to be available (working hours), my expectation is that I can send you a message and expect a prompt response. If you and I are in the same physical location, and you don't have headphones on, I reserve the right to approach you respectfully if I need something. If you have headphones, I will contact you digitally before directly, in all cases. 
* **Quality of Work** - I expect that you will deliver your best work, considering the impact your work will have on the team, on the product, and on the customers in every case. If we need to come up with a mutually-agreeable definition of the word 'done' in order to have a productive working relationship, I am willing to put effort into that.
* **Transparency** - You are not required to tell me everything in your life. That would take a long time, and while I would probably be very interested in the story, it isn't necessary for us to be able to work together. However, if there is information you believe I should know, please share it with me. Lies, whether through misdirection or omission, do not contribute to positive and productive work environments. 
* **Respect** - My expectation is that you will always treat me with respect. That's not because of my role as a leader within `${COMPANY}`, it's not because of any comparison of skill or knowledge. It's because I'm a person. 

I reserve the right to initiate communication and push for a resolution if there ever comes the unfortunate situation where you do not live up to my expectations. If my role is to be accountable for a product for which you are responsible, then I expect to be able to hold you accountable for its success.

### Joining a team

In the first thirty days after I join a team, I will endeavour to understand the system. Things I will want to understand include finding out who is responsible, who is accountable for delivering each product, what is the cadence that the team uses which defines the various SDLC stages, and where are the unseen gaps that exist in every team and pipeline. I don't want to change anything in those first thirty days unless I can see something that is obviously broken. In truth, I hate managers that come in and want to change something to make their initial impact be felt. I'm joining your team, so I need to understand how you perform before I can begin to have the hubris to believe that I can improve it.

In the next two to three months, I will attempt to work with the insights I have generated since joining. As I identify opportunities for improvement or revision and align with my superiors on what their priorities are, I will meet with the stakeholders for each initiative and outline my insights. This allows me to understand historical drivers of decisions, and also offers me the opportunity to present alternatives.

## Meetings

Meetings have two purposes in my world. We are either looking back(retrospectives, or just retros), or looking forward(planning and/or strategy). If you do not need my perspective or input to accomplish either one of those purposes, I respectfully ask you omit me from the meeting invite. If you feel that I need to be aware of the fact the meeting exists, an e-mail or instant message will suffice. I reserve the right to question my inclusion in any meeting invitation.

Retros should be focused on identifying successes, discovering areas of opportunity, and scheduling a planning meeting to develop strategies around moving forward more productively. Planning and strategy sessions should be timeboxed and have an agenda. I encourage SMART goals wherever possible. I expect that meetings that are scheduled for a time block will take the full time. I also expect that meetings that can end early, do. 

If you are requesting my attendance and participation in another type of group discussion, let's explore that and communicate effectively! Working with smart people excites me. Is it a brainstorm session, is it a focused whiteboard jam session on an idea, or do you have a really excellent banana bread recipe you'd like to share? Schedule accordingly, and I will do my best to never waste your time.

I do not like meetings that occur so that we can talk about what we would do if we were not in a meeting. I do not like meetings that could be accomplished with a well-researched e-mail. If you take up thirty minutes of both of our days because you could not spend ten minutes pulling together resources, links, or data into an e-mail, then you have not planned adequately. I do not like meetings whose purpose is to get my feedback on something that I am seeing for the first time, **in the meeting**. Please send me resources ahead of time, so that I may arrive with an informed opinion, instead of an instinctive one.

I invite other arms of the business (Marketing, Sales, Recruiting, Customer Support) to ask to meet with me, so that we can partner to meet everyone's needs. Meet with me early, and we can look back at what has worked well and what needs improvement. Meet with me on an ongoing basis and we can continue to look forward at how Engineering can help you do what you want and need to do to move the product and business forward.

I will endeavour to always show up to any meeting prepared, informed, and engaged. If I have been unable to be any of those things, I will be transparent about it, and we can decide if rescheduling or re-purposing the meeting to another medium is more effective. If I check my phone during the meeting, it is not a sign of disrespect. My role at `${COMPANY}` requires a certain level of availability and awareness, and I ask that you accommodate that with my occasional and infrequent checks for urgent communications.

## 1:1s (One on One Meetings)

These are not status updates, these are scheduled, purposeful meetings where we are looking forward on YOUR timeline. Not mine. I have people to whom I report that are looking at that timeline with me. So, these meetings are about how I can help you move forward and grow as you progress on your timeline. They are planning and strategy sessions. This isn't restricted to just your time at `${COMPANY}`, it's about your path as a professional. 

These meetings are also your opportunity to give me feedback. I welcome it. It won't anger me, unless you attack me personally. But that isn't feedback, so I wouldn't be expecting it. In fact, with a priority on respect, I would have the expectation that we would never have that kind of conversation. Giving me feedback allows us to work together more productively in the future. 

I am very interested in how you see your contributions, how you see your skills developing, and what goals you have for the future. Having had a diverse and interesting career so far myself, I relish the opportunity to offer advice or insight based on my own experiences. Rather than like consultation or mentorship, I want to be a coach who can look at where you are now and ask you the hard questions and offer the keen insights that allow you to grow from where you are now towards where you want to be.

## Problem Solving

I do not like the 'swoop and poop' style of problem solving. I prefer to treat problems that come up with feedback being the primary mechanic that informs action. In the 'swoop and poop' the following cycle occurs:

1. Problem is hypothesized - "Oh %#$!&, I think there is a problem"
2. Problem is identified - "Yep. Problem. Better tell Don."
3. Problem is reported - "Don, there is a problem. It is now your problem."
4. Me: O_o

The issue I have with this formula is that the problem hasn't advanced any further towards resolution. You've developed an understanding of the situation and then simply handed it off to me. Now I have to start a whole new cycle of developing my own understanding of the problem in order to determine the best way to fix it.

Using a feedback mechanism, we now get the following cycle:

1. Problem is hypothesized - "Oh %#!$^, I think there is a problem."
2. Problem is identified - "Yep. Problem. How would I fix this?"
3. Solution is developed - "I think this might actually work."
4. Situation is reported - "Hey Don, I found this problem, and here is how I propose it should be fixed."

Now, I can do these things:

5. Triage (aka Collaborate based on Feedback) - "Let's set a priority for this problem. Let's figure out the scope of this problem. Let's figure out who else this problem affects."
6. Inform - "To all the people that this affects, here are our available solutions. Please provide feedback."
7. Listen - "Thank you for your feedback."
8. Execute solution - "The problem has been solved."

Even if you don't have a proposal for how it can be fixed, if you come to me with the mentality of 'Hey, there is a problem and I want to engage you in developing a solution', then we are far more likely to build trust with each other going forward. 

In the above preferred process, there are twice as many steps. That's because we are a team, meaning we have a feedback loop that allows us to collaborate, explore, and resolve issues together. More people can do more things and delegate the work. It doesn't matter if this is a code bug or a missing coffee filter, the above strategy will always work better than just leaving a note on my desk that the new release of the thingamajig widget is phlarbed<sup>*</sup>. 

Communication is critical. If the problem is about my behaviour or execution in my role, it is critical to me that I get your insights and feedback into finding a solution. If the problem is about your behaviour or execution in your role, I want the opportunity to offer my feedback in how we can find success for you. If the problem is the widget, let's figure out how it got into a phlarbed<sup>\*</sup> state and what the best way is to de-phlarb<sup>*</sup> it. 

> * Phlarbed (adj.) - Highly technical term for something being in an undesirable, likely unusable state. Often, the details of its state are less important than the fact that the state is undesirable. More polite than other words that could be used. This term may have been made up on the spot to prevent profanity.

## Feedback

I will give it to you whenever I feel it is necessary, and I will always expect that you will be receptive. You are not required to implement any of it, ever. Your values should always be a higher priority than my preferences. If we are not aligned, I want to open up communication so that we can find a clear path forward.

I will ask you to give it whenever you want. I am not required to implement it, however if it was important enough to you to open up and bring it to my attention, I am going to give it the respect it deserves. 

I both deliver and receive feedback best, verbally. If you would like written feedback, or have some for me, I am open and receptive to that form as well. 

Because I prioritize growth over comfort, I do not tend to sugar-coat my feedback, and have no need for you to do so. Just be respectful, and I will always try to be the same.

## Conclusion

I may be new to you, but I am not new to being a technologist. I might even be new to your team, but I am not new to wanting the best for those that I work with. And even if I am new to this product, I am not new to collaborating with amazing people who want to build great things with the best tech we can manifest. 

I look forward to the opportunity to work with you every day to create great things, to accomplish goals of which we can both be proud, together.
